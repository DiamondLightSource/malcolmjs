MalcolmJS
=========

MalcolmJS is a web application for interacting with Malcolm (typically inside
a PANDA box), allowing a view on the resulting attributes as well as being 
able to modify settings.

Malcolm is a middlelayer framework that implements high level configure/run
behaviour of control system components like those used in continuous scans.

Malcolm was created as part of the Mapping project at Diamond Light Source
in order to improve the performance of continuous scanning.
