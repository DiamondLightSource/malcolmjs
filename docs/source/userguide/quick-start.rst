Quick Start
=============

This quick start walkthrough aims to show you how a simple workflow might be carried out using MalcolmJS, it will be brief but the user interface should feel intuitive enough that this guide will allow you to get started quickly on your own instance.

#. Start by navigating to ``http://{malcolm host}/gui/`` where ``malcolm host`` is the malcolm instance you're trying to connect to, e.g. ``localhost:3000``
