Working With Charts
===================

 The PandA User Interface provides a near-realtime graphical representation of values associated with an `attribute_` against time.  Plotting begins at the time the Attribute was selected and is intended as a 'for information only' representation of the Attribute's characteristics and history for the snapshot of time over which the plot remains open.

 PandA attempts to render every attribute as a chart.  In doing so it handled the different Attribute formats available in different ways.

 * **Discrete numberical data** is displayed as a ...
 * **Text data** is displayed in a similar way to discrete numberical data with the Y axis representing each different text string specified.

Once displayed you have a number of tools at your disposal to support interaction with the chart.  Hovering the mouse pointer over the chart displays the chart menu bar.  The following options are available:

* **Edit in Chart Studio** - generates a snapshot of the data behind the plot and exports it to the online Chart Studio tool.
* **Zoom** - 
* **Pan** - 
* **Zoom in/out** -

* **Reset Axes** - 
* **Toggle Spike Lines** -
