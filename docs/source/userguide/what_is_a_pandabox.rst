Getting Started
===============

This user guide introduces the web-based environment, toolkit and processes available to you as you develop and manage your Control System through its integrated user interface.  This interface allows you to:

    * Design and configure the building blocks and linkages between them as a *virtual representation* of you control system.
    * Optimise your design through interaction with the physical hardware of your control system implementation.
    * Utilise and manage your design in in real-world operational scenarios through monitoring and basic analysis tools.
    * Save your design for re-use later, or for traceability purposes in support of good scientific practice.
