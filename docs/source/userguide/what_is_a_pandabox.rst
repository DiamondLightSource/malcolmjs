How is the Documentation Structured
-----------------------------------

PandA documentation is divided into several main sections.  It begins with a general overview of what a PandA is and a `Quick Start <quick_start_guide_>` for those already familiar with its concepts.  For those requiring more detailed information on implementation we provide details of the PandA`technical implementation <technical_overview_>`.  

We then provide a general tour to the `user interface <user_interface_overview_>`.

**TO FINISH**

A range of common technical terms and PandA-specific introduced and used throughout the documentation.  To aid consistency, readability and accuracy, specific definition of these are included in the `Glossary <glossary_>`.
